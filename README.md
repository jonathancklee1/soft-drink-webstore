## About The Project

E-Drinks is a fictional online beverage e-commerce that is built around the React framework, utilising both Redux and Styled Components. This project is specialised for the front-end of the landing page of the website with a focus on small interactive features like an image carousel and hamburger menu. The development process allowed me to be introduced to both Redux data layers and styling using Styled Components.
